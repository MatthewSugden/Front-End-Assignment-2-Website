	During the development of my website many problems and errors occurred. 
	The major error in which I had first encountered was with my navigation bar. 
	Making this a viable and efficient method of navigation through my website was a tall order for me, 
	as when I tried to fix one problem another would arise. I overcame this with the help of my peers and tutors in labs.

	One of the most effective elements that I put in use whilst creating my website was wireframes.
	They were extremely useful for me as they gave me a basic idea of how i wanted my website to look,
	making it much easier to create and develop. I created a wireframe before i started the deveopment of each page of my website.
	As a result of this, the wireframes do not resemble my finished project precisely because development took longer than expected 
	as the pages themselves went through many iterations before reaching completion.
