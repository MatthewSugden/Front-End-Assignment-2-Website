			<h2>Trippie Redd</h2>
			<p>Trippie Redd is one of the greatest artists to emerge in 2016/17. With his off tone singing and catchy lyrics.
			The release of two mixtapes "A Letter to You" and "A Love Letter to You 2", caused mainstream access to 26 new tracks from 
			this well established Soundcloud Artist.
			
			Similar to: Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Yatchy</p>

			<h2>Eli Sostre</h2>
			<p>Eli Sostre has been making music for a few years now but has not recieved the recognition he deserves, as he is still 
			relatively underground considering he makes outstanding music. With the release of his mixtape "Still Up at Night" and his 2017 release 
			of "Sleep is for the Week" found him gain some of the appreciation he truly deserves. I seriously recommend checking these projects out if 
			you listen to the likes of: Roy Woods and Bryson Tiller.</p>

			<h2>Tame Impala</h2>
			<p>One of the more recognised artits on this list as they already have a global following but this Australian band should be listened by everyone 
			as their psychedelic sound is truly something else that is only achieved by Kevin Parker and crew. Absolute Must Listen!
			
			Similar to: Joy Division and Mac DeMarco</p>

			<h2>Josh A</h2>
			  <p>
			  Josh A is an outstanding artist who has vivd production on every track and is not short of amazing projects. My personal favourite from him 
			  is "Retroland". This project is seamless from start to finish showing off amazing production and meaningful lyrics, one that i think everyone should check out.
			  Similar to: Jaden Smith and Tyler, the Creator</p>
