		<p>
		Jaden Smith's debut album Syre, was not a dissapointement in any shape of the imagination. It was a spectacle to behold, that took you through the 
		emotion of Jaden himself. The album tackled real issues whilst also producing tracks that were hard hitting and unforgettable. The album created
		imagery that could only be matched by the likes of Frank Ocean and Tyler, the Creator. Production was not at a loss on this album using every element of 
		music from electric guitars to idealistic soundscapes to romantic vocals from his sister Willow Smith.
		This may be a biased review, as I may be a huge Jaden fan boy but I truly and honestly believe he deserves every milimetre of my admiration. He is truly a musical genius
		within the new generation and at the age of 19 he will only excel and become better.

		<p>
		Yellow Days are a relatively new discovery to musical arsenal. Emerging on to the scene in late 2016 this young band from the United Kingdom deserve
		every ounce of recognition they have recieved. Their music does not compare to anything else I have listened to, the only artist that comes close is
		King Krul, who is also an amazing band. Another debut album which has resonated utterly with me and will be an all time favourite for the rest of my life.
		Tackling amazing themes that everyone goes through: Love, rejection, fitting in but the thing that attracts me most about this album is the positivity.
		This is shown through a personal faourite song on the album "That Easy", which is all about nevery giving up and pressing on to complete what ever you 
		goal or task may be. This album features wonderful guitar, fantastic synths, vibing drums and uniquely powerful Vocals. The vocals from George within this band
		are unmatched by any other singer, the emotion he portrays in his voice is truly beautiful, this can easily be seen if you ever have the pleasure of seeing
		Yellow Days perform live. Yellow Days are not a band you will forget and they will honestly be a stable name in music forever, with their heartfelt lyrics
		 and educationally relevant samples.

		<p>
		XXXTentacion personally shocked me with his debut album, through the emotionally crippling music he produced for this project. He did not lie when he said 
		this album was an invitation into his mind and world. This was the first time i truly felt emotion through music, opening my eyes to another level of music 
		in which I did not think existed. The songs in which I truly believe you can feel the experiences he has been through are: "Depression & Obssesion", "Save Me" and 
		"Dead Inside". Despite this I truly believe you are getting a bit of XXXTentacion in every single one of the songs he created. The only fall back to this album 
		is it's length but this can be excused by the emotionally toll it must have took to make each and every one of these songs. A true refelction and ode to XXXTentacion
		 and I loved every second of it.
